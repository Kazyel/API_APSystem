# Elena APIs Repository

This repo contains the two REST APIs that I created with the goal of serving the [Elena](https://elenalab.com.br/site/) application with all the processed data collected from a variety of solar panels.

This current repository is **OUTDATED**. The updated version is private in the repository of the company. 

There were many improvements done: Performance, better UI for the panels, cleaner code and file organization.
