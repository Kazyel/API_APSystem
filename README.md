# Elena APIs Repository

This repo contains the REST APIs created with the purpose of serving the [Elena](https://elenalab.com.br/site/) application with all the processed data collected from a variety of solar panels which resides in my state current governor's house.

The collected data is then used to create visual representations of the real panels via SVG models. The goal is to facilitate the monitoring and analyzing of all the energy being generated across the span of days, months and years.


## Warning

This current repository is **OUTDATED**. The updated version is private in the repository of the company. 

There were many improvements done: performance, specially better UI for the panels, cleaner code and file organization was also improved.
