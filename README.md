This API fetches data from a database which is storing collected data from solar panels that are serving a bunch of statistics, like the amount of energy produced in a day.

Then, the received data can be shown through charts in a really simple page only for demonstration and practice purposes.

## To-do 🗒️
-   ~~Better labels for timestamp.~~
-   ~~More charts.~~
-   Filtering data by day.
-   Re-fetch button by data selected.
-   Error Handling.
